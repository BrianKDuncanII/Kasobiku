        <p>In a time where the gaming space is flowing with countless numbers of mediocre horror games, trying too hard to be action games, it’s very rare that we see a game that harkens back to classical horror roots. These games take the genre back to a time when horror meant something, and it was more than just cheap jumpscares and Michael Bay level action. Capcom’s newest game is a remake of the classic from 1998, Resident Evil 2. And I’d be lying if I said the remake doesn’t do the original game justice.</p>
        <p>On Steam I’ve clocked in about 20 hours in the game so far, and there’s still plenty for me to experience and I can’t wait to jump back in and play some more. The game has heaps of content to keep the player engaged with the game for well over the time that I’ve played so far. </p>
            
            <p>With multiple playthroughs, excellent puzzles, dynamic difficulty, accessibility for speedrunning, great characters, and so much more, this game has A LOT in it for the typical $60 price-tag. It’s important to establish that I’ve never played the original Resident Evil 2, but I have played some other games in the series, such as Resident Evil 4, which I had a blast playing, especially with co-op, and the more recent entry, Resident Evil 7. I enjoy these games for what they are, and what they’re trying to be in terms of their design and philosophy. And I can safely say that RE:2 deserves to be recognized in a top-tier list for RE fans.</p>
        <p>In the first few hours with the game, the first thing I immediately noticed was how old-school the game felt in terms of its design. It felt more akin to something like Silent Hill, than any other contemporary horror game out there. Most modern horror games focus too much on cheap jump scares to deliver a supposed illusion of being scared, but more often than not it just leads to frustration, and showcases a lack of originality. There’s also a lot of emphasis placed on action in horror, with games like The Evil Within series and even some poorly thought-through Resident Evil games. I’d argue that this type of horror is lackluster, and fails to deliver on a great experience. Sure, running from the same enemy for an entire 8 hours and hiding in lockers can be exhilarating, but from a design perspective, it’s lazy, it’s contrived, and it can only keep a gamer entertained for so long before it seems like a haunted house more than anything else.</p>

        <p>I love Resident Evil 2 because it feels like a video game first and a horror game second. It truly feels fun to play, and I love all the mechanics that go into it. The gameplay feels great and is something reminiscent to that of the beloved Silent Hill series, where you’re tasked with solving puzzles, while trying to make your way around crazy amounts of zombies and other enemies. Oh, and yes you heard me right, I said zombies. One could argue that zombies in movies and video games has been done to death, but the way this game does it makes zombies feel fresh again, and truly scary. I believe this is due to the excellent survival horror elements of the game, where you’re constantly under stress of managing your inventory, keeping track of your ammunition, and keeping the two characters Leon or Claire from going under. There’s plenty of survival horror games on steam as I’m sure you’ve noticed, and this game definitely shakes up the genre and makes something that’s kind of a joke in the gaming scene now, something interesting and fun.</p>

                Graphics, and atmosphere, oh man is this not something that horror games are actually very good at. Immersion is immensely important in the horror genre, and it’s good to see that Resident Evil 2 is one of the most gorgeous games I’ve played. On all consoles too! It looks great on my PS4 and it runs great on my PC - thank you Capcom for actually making a PC port that rocks. I feel like if there’s any genre that definitely has pushed the envelope for technical achievement in video games it’s horror. I know I’m bringing up Silent Hill a lot, but it’s important to note just how influential and important that game was at the time. The first game in the series was a technical marvel, and the use of fog in the game allowed them to get away with things not seen before on the PS1.</p><p> What they did with the hardware is truly awesome, and it’s good to see that Resident Evil 2 also pushes even consoles to their limits. With the Xbox One and PS4 base consoles running at 60fps, and looking gorgeous while doing it. I mostly played the game on PC however. In short, the game looks great, and I love the atmosphere with the rain. And the sewer sections are drenched in terror, and I hadn’t felt this absolutely drenched in that feeling since I first played PT a long time ago. Rest in peace.

                Horror in games fortunately has a pretty good track record of having at least good stories, good characters, or both. However, good voice acting can be hit or miss. Resident Evil 2 doesn’t necessarily shine with its story, it’s interesting and it will make you motivated to keep pressing forward, but I think where the game shines is with its characters. You can play either as Claire or Leon, each with their own stories, and both of their runs feel fresh even if you decide to play both. This style of storytelling is something I really enjoyed about NieR: Automata.It’s unconventional, and really gives the game a decent amount of replayability. Though some people might argue it can be lazy at times and adds artificial longevity to the game. However, In RE: 2 it’s done quite well, and I really enjoyed playing through the game’s 4 different runs. No spoilers this commentary, you’re welcome guys.

                Speaking of replay value, this game is jam packed full of all kinds of things to do. As I’ve stated before you can play this game for well over 20 hours, though I must admit I do like to take my time with games and soak up as much immersion as I can. I know that some players enjoy steamrolling through games and that’s okay too, you’ll still get enjoyment out of this. And hell, I even enjoy watching people speedrun this game, it’s pretty impressive. And the game lends itself to being a great speed-running game. The different runs and the dynamic difficulty makes this game definitely replayable.</p> <p>But what’s that you ask? Dynamic difficulty? Well, think of it as kind of a director for games. Left 4 Dead is really good at doing this with it’s AI director. Essentially, the game watches how you’re performing and adjusts the difficulty accordingly. Dying too often at bosses? It’ll reduce the amount of zombies and give you more items. Steamrolling through the whole game? Let’s through in some harder enemies and even more zombies. It gives the game a nice progression and flow, and prevents the game from becoming stale, and you never truly feel like you know EVERYTHING about the game. And I believe that’s important for replayability.

                To add-on to all the existing content, Capcom has also done some pretty consumer-friendly business practices this time around. With the inclusion of paid, and free DLC. Something similar to how CD Projekt Red handled The Witcher. The free DLC is mostly just speed-running episodes and fun little mini games of see how fast you can get through levels. But they still add decent content and can be a load of fun if you get bored just playing the main campaign. And there’s plenty to unlock if you’re into that kind of thing.

                Something I wanted to point out about the design of RE: 2 is they kind of switched up the design of the camera this time around, similar to how RE: 7 introduced a First-person perspective to the series for the first time, which fans actually loved and they pulled that off pretty well. This time the game features an over-the-shoulder type of camera, rather than the fixed camera angle from the original 1998 game. While from a design perspective, this can take away from that horror feel, as not being in control of the camera can actually present some interesting and horrifying scenarios, it also does the game some justice too.</p><p> Something I find really important in video games is freedom, and the ability for the player to be as skilled as they want to be. And having an over-the-shoulder view I think is a great addition to an already great game. It gives the player freedom to look around, while also keeping that limited view and keeping the horror in-place. Even though the controls are quick and snappy, especially with a keyboard and mouse, you still never feel like you’re 100% in control, and I believe that’s how horror should be. You shouldn’t have a grasp of everything, there should still be some kind of looseness to it, otherwise, it loses its charm.

        <p>
                Overall I believe RE:2 is what every remake should strive to be. It’s a great horror game, a great action game, and really just a great game in general. It’s been met with critical acclaim, and wonderful reviews on Steam, and for good reason. When you put hard work into a game,  I believe you will see the fruits of your labor. And I think that applies not only to video games, but just to anything in general. It’s good to see that the Resident Evil series has been getting good treatment that it deserves, and I can’t wait to see where Capcom takes the series next. I 100% recommend this game, whether you’re a fan of horror games, or action games, or even puzzle games, it has a lot for varying audiences.
